# What to Wear
### By trojanface

## Description
I got tired of selecting an outfit every day. I created this app to analyse the weather and make a recommendation of what to wear based on some color coordination and basic style rules.

NOTE: This is a simple client side app. The clothing items are hardcoded in. I did this for convenience of development and as it's not targeted toward other users. Maybe one day I'll make a commercial version where users can add new items and select what they do and don't have in their wardrobe.

## Link to Deployed App

## Installation
1. Visit deployed application.

## Usage
1. Select category of outfit.
2. Press 'Generate' to create a new outfit.
3. Press 'Spice' to add more color to your outfit.
4. Use 'Colder' and 'Warmer' buttons to adjust your outfit if the day feels different to the base temperature.
5. Use the shuffle button beneath each item to generate an alternative item if one meets the rules.
6. Use the trash button beneath each item to delete a clothing item.
